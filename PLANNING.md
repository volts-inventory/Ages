# Ages — Planning

## Current state

All seven planned milestones (M0 through M6) have shipped end-to-
end and merged into main. The species + multi-civ + post-run-
report pipeline is feature-complete against the AGENTS.md vision.
The project has moved out of milestone-build mode into tuning +
polish.

What runs end-to-end on `./run.sh`:

- Substrate-first planet sampling (Aqueous / Ammoniacal /
  Hydrocarbon / Silicate); every seed produces life of *some*
  chemistry.
- Hex-grid physics (heat, fluid, hydrology, magnetism, Lorentz,
  Coriolis, tides, radiation, vertical convection) with operator
  splitting; everything threads through Q32.32 fixed-point real
  arithmetic.
- 39 authored recognition templates plus emergent-template
  discovery from civ-confirmed thresholds; species canon adopts
  newly named phenomena across civ collapse boundaries.
- Per-civ hypothesizer with two parallel tracks (firing relations
  + continuous measurement relations), 12 form vocabulary,
  Occam-adjusted refinement on probation, rivals pool with
  displacement, theory hierarchy 3 levels deep.
- Predict-and-falsify: confirmed relations track a falsification
  streak; sustained mispredictions force refinement.
- Inheritance + revalidation: successors re-fit transmitted
  relations after a 50-tick window; failures emit
  `RelationLapsed` and drop.
- Mid-comprehension mythologization band: low-comprehension
  transmissions don't pass the relation but nudge the receiving
  civ's cosmology along an axis aligned with the relation's
  themes.
- Civ-built experiment apparatus: tier-2 capability tool for
  ToolExtension-bearing species; clamped-channel ladder
  experiments feed the hypothesizer's measurement track at 2×
  weighting and mark confirmed relations as experimental.
- 58-tool tech tree with strict prereqs + serendipitous unlocks;
  emergent tools propose from confirmed-relation clusters; both
  fold through the same effect aggregator across 8 effect
  categories.
- Per-cell heterogeneous populations with substrate-derived
  demographics, gradient-driven migration, nomadic species
  pool, habitat-priority diffusion, per-terrain habitability
  multipliers.
- Cohesion-driven civil war + breakaway path; multi-tick wars
  with marching front; belligerence-driven war declaration
  gated on contact + kinship-dampened drive score.
- Two-layer culture: slow-drift species-anchored cosmology
  (5 axes), fast-divergent civ-keyed religion (3 axes); kinship
  weighted dominantly by religion.
- Live ASCII viewport sharing the post-run report's frame
  renderer (default 36×30 grid, 74-column themed-box layout).
- Markdown post-run report (`ages-report`) with paired
  ownership/density spatial keyframes, war campaigns, per-civ
  scientific-lifecycle counters, highlight reel.
- Python prose narrator (`narrate.py`) consuming the same
  NDJSON via `RunMetadata` label tables.
- Open civilizational-archetype framework: every run scored across
  11 peer levers (no privileged default, no fallback), labelled
  pure / hybrid / emergent; an orthogonal cognition overlay
  (individual / collective / substrate-distributed); a world+species
  prior refined by the realized run trajectory; a first-class
  resonance physics field + recognition templates + discovery
  channel so field-sensing civs do real resonance science; and a
  divergent endpoint per archetype at transcendence. Surfaced via
  the additive `ArchetypeDerived` / `ArchetypeEndpoint` events in
  both narrators.

A representative seed-42 / 5000-year run produces ~14 civs,
7000+ confirmed relations, 1800+ knowledge transmissions across
collapse boundaries, 4000+ conflict skirmishes grouped into war
campaigns, ~1000 lines of report.

## Last change

Civilizational-archetype framework (8 commits). Generalized the
sim's implicit combustion-privileged developmental path into an
open space of 11 peer levers (combustion, field_resonance,
biochemical, cryogenic, mechanical, hydraulic, exotic_chemistry,
plasma_em, gravitational, photonic, nuclear) scored identically with
no default and no fallback. The classifier
(`sim/civ/src/archetype.rs`) is open — pure / named-hybrid /
signature-named-emergent — so unforeseen paths are still detected
and labelled; a 12-seed prior sweep yields 12 distinct labels across
every lever family. An orthogonal cognition overlay (individual /
collective / substrate-distributed) bends a fate inward toward
silence at the endpoint. Each lever's score is a world+species prior
refined by the realized run trajectory (confirmed-relation channels +
unlocked tool clusters). A new additive per-cell resonance field in
`sim/physics` (legacy channels bit-identical) makes the
field/resonance lever first-class: recognition gained
`Field::Resonance` + `resonance_field_active` / `attention_coherence`
templates, discovery gained a resonance channel, so field-sensing
species do genuine resonance science. At transcendence each archetype
reaches a divergent endpoint (one per lever) rather than a shared
singularity; the `transcendence` run-end reason is unchanged. Two
additive events — `ArchetypeDerived` (run start) and
`ArchetypeEndpoint` (transcendence) — surface through both the Rust
prose narrator and `narrate.py`. Pure Q32.32, no RNG; labels stable
across replays. See [`docs/archetype.md`](docs/archetype.md).

Prior change — workspace audit pass — three iterations of concrete
duplication removal, no behavioural change (post-run reports
byte-identical seed-42 / 50-year before and after).

Iter 1 — helpers + dead code. `Real::clamp01()`,
`Pop::to_real_nonneg()`, `impl From<(i64, i64)> for Real` added to
`sim/arith`; ~65 inline `.max(Real::ZERO).min(Real::ONE)` shapes,
5 `Real::from_int(p.raw().to_num::<i64>().max(0))` chains, and 56
`Real::from_ratio(CONST.0, CONST.1)` calls rewritten through the
crates. Collapsed eight `render_world_frame_*` wrappers in
`sim/report/src/frame.rs` into one `render_world_frame_styled` +
`FrameStyle`; the viewport emitter's 47-line dispatch shrinks to
one call. Deleted dead `pick_best_habitable_cell` and its stale
`#[allow(unused_imports)]` shim; tightened `contact.rs` helpers to
private.

Iter 2 — `Real::percent(n)`. 549 literal `Real::from_ratio(n, 100)`
sites across every crate rewritten as `Real::percent(n)`.

Iter 3 — module + struct splits. `sim/civ/src/tech/specs.rs`
(1969 lines, nine methods) split into a `specs/` directory:
`mod.rs` keeps the six smaller methods + the resource-threshold
tables; `relations.rs`, `tools.rs`, `manipulation.rs` each hold
one big match. Viewport emitter's ten parallel
`BTreeMap<u32, …>` fields for per-civ sidebar state folded into a
single `CivState` struct (`name`, `founded_year`, `cosmology`,
`religion`, `tech_tier`, `tools_unlocked`, `cohesion`,
`life_expectancy_months`, `last_unlocked_tool`); ten `.remove()`
calls in the `CivCollapsed` handler collapse to one. The
render-cycle pop-snapshot cache (`civ_last_emitted_pop_q32`)
stays separate — wholesale-replace semantics don't fit the
struct model.

Form-fit dispatch in `sim/civ/src/fit.rs` was evaluated and left
alone: the audit's proposed `FormFitter` trait would require 12
unit structs + dyn dispatch to replicate what `match self` already
does in one place, with seven different return types that no
single trait can capture.

## How to use this file

This file's **Current state** + **Last change** sections (above)
are the resumption anchor for mid-task work. The file deliberately
does not restate the project's vision or goals — those live
elsewhere:

- [`README.md`](README.md) — public-facing entry: how to run it.
- [`docs/PROJECT.md`](docs/PROJECT.md) — vision principles
  tabulated against shipped features.
- [`docs/MANIFEST.md`](docs/MANIFEST.md) — full doc index.

When the change is substantial (new feature, scope shift), update
**Current state** and **Last change** above. When changing
design, also update the affected per-crate README + the relevant
per-feature doc + `docs/MANIFEST.md` in the same commit.

## Future maybe

Currently outside the project vision; could land later if the
direction shifts and a concrete consumer surfaces:

- **LLM in the loop or in post-processing** — hard rule. Can
  be added downstream by a user over the event log; not part
  of this project.
- **Native-GUI live UI** — terminal-only. (A live *ASCII*
  viewport ships as `--cli=viewport`.)
- **Networked multi-process sims** — single-process by design.
- **Save/load formats beyond snapshots** — periodic `Snapshot`
  digests cover the replay/checkpoint use case.
- **Mod hooks** — project framing.
- **Per-individual general population** — vision boundary.
- **Inter-planet civ contact** — single-planet by design.
- **Multi-species worlds** — single-species by design.
- **Quantum-scale physics** — vision boundary.
- **Turbulent fluid regimes** — computationally infeasible at
  planet scale.
- **Real meteorology fidelity** — vision boundary.
- **Audio** — project framing.
- **Web viewer** — could return if a downstream consumer asks.

## Historical

For the design-decision log (Q-record archive), see
[docs/decisions/INDEX.md](docs/decisions/INDEX.md). It is not
a source of truth for current behavior — the per-feature docs
in `docs/*.md` are.
